If, like me, you've been struggling to understand the Espressif RMT peripheral, you may find this useful. The code is taken directly from the ESP32 OneWire DS18B20 example, which uses the Espressif OneWire componment.  I have simplified the code and consolidated it into two C++ classes.  The result is, hopefully, more readable than the original.

Please note that ths is not intended to be a library and you will probably need to modify and expand the code to fit your own application.
